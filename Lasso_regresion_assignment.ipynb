    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression: Lasso stands for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator.\" Lasso uses the L1 regularization\n",
    "term, which adds the absolute values of the coefficients to the linear regression cost function. The L1 regularization\n",
    "encourages coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively leading to automatic feature selection. Some coefficients may\n",
    "be eliminated entirely, resulting in a sparse model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression: Ridge regression uses the L2 regularization term, which adds the squared values of the coefficients \n",
    "to the cost function. The L2 regularization encourages coefficient values to be small but not necessarily zero. As a \n",
    "result, all coefficients are shrunk towards zero, but none are exactly eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso: Lasso's L1 regularization inherently leads to feature selection. It can drive some coefficients to exactly \n",
    "zero, effectively excluding the corresponding predictor variables from the model. This makes lasso useful when you \n",
    "suspect that only a subset of predictors are truly relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge: Ridge regression does not perform feature selection to the same extent as lasso. While it reduces the impact \n",
    "of less important features by shrinking their coefficients, it typically retains all predictor variables in the model, \n",
    "albeit with reduced influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coefficient Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso: Lasso's strong feature selection can lead to a model with fewer predictor variables, which makes it more\n",
    "interpretable and efficient when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. However, if two or more predictors are \n",
    "highly correlated, lasso might arbitrarily select one and exclude the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge: Ridge regression retains all predictor variables, which can be beneficial when you believe that most of the\n",
    "predictors have some degree of relevance. It can help to alleviate multicollinearity and reduce the variance of c\n",
    "oefficient estimates."
